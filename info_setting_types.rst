RR Info and Setting Types
=========================

Info and setting types are used for getting information and setting options on various data in the RadeonRays library. All of these are a type with an enum list of possible values.

Most of these types can be referred by value. However, in most cases it is better to refer to them by name, so if future versions of the API change values, the existing code does not need to be changed.
